<h4>Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants: Seeds</h4>
            <p>In flowering plants, sexual reproduction occurs through the formation of seeds. Pollination allows the fertilized egg to develop into a seed, which grows into a new plant under suitable conditions.</p>

    <h3>7. Techniques for Plant Propagation (e.g., Stem Cuttings, Marcotting, Grafting, Leaf Cutting)</h3>
    <p>
        People have devised various ways or techniques to propagate plants from parts of other plants. This allows for quicker growth and the production of new plants without needing to start from seeds.

    <div id="learn-more-plant-propagation" class="learn-more-content">
        <h4>Stem Cuttings</h4>
        <p>In stem cutting, a portion of a plant's stem is cut off and planted in soil or water to grow a new plant. This is common with plants like roses, geraniums, and lavender. The cutting will develop roots, and a new plant will emerge.</p>
        <img src="https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780323906364000222-f05-01-9780323906364.jpg" alt="Stem Cutting Propagation" />

        <h4>Marcotting (Air Layering)</h4>
        <p>Marcotting involves inducing root growth on a branch while it is still attached to the parent plant. The branch is wounded, covered with moist soil or moss, and wrapped in plastic to keep it humid. Once roots form, the branch is cut off and planted separately.</p>

        <h4>Grafting</h4>
        <p>Grafting involves joining two plant parts together to form a new plant. One part (the scion) is taken from a desired plant and attached to another part (the rootstock), which is often hardier. This is commonly done in fruit trees like apples and citrus to combine desirable traits such as fruit production and disease resistance.</p>

        <h4>Leaf Cutting</h4>
        <p>Leaf cutting is when a healthy leaf is cut from a plant and used to grow a new plant. This method is often used with succulents like jade plants or African violets. The leaf, when placed in soil, develops roots and a new plant begins to grow from it.</p>
